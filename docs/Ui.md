# Jadwiga UI

Jadwiga UI consists of a single multi-line text control imitating an old-school text terminal.

Interaction is an alternate series of utterances, starting with User's message followed by 
Jadwiga's response.

User can type in a message after a prompt character (`">"`).

The conversation history is visible in the text control. 

Every time the page is visited or refreshed, the text control content is cleared and a new conversation
begins.
